        <h1>My Backstory</h1>
        <p>I started programming when I was around 13 years old. When I started it was mainly free projects & passion projects to track my progress. My main language I not only started on, but stuck with for 5+ years is Java. I learned a lot from Java with general programming knowledge. Java taught me the fundamentals, variables, primitives, asynchronous programming, documentation, apis, and naming conventions. The Java projects I developed were used for production. They needed to be very optimized & have a good code base. These projects I developed & sold were made for people to be able to build off of them with ease & not need to read through tons of documentation to understand it.</p>

        <h1>My Takeaway</h1>
        <p>My main takeaway from all of the projects I created in my time with Java is that no project is ever finished. There's always something you can add, tweak, modify, optimize, and so much more. You also can't look at the code like it's black and white there's much more ways to look at it and always other alternatives to make it run more effectively. I think that's something that sets me aside from other developers. I strive for a more perfect & efficient way of writing code. I also love learning and do projects on the basis of learning new things.</p>

        <h1>My Strengths</h1>
        <p>One strength I believe outweighs the rest is doing things on my own, but also not being scared to ask for help. A way I'd describe that strength would be pride. I don't let my pride or my ego get in the way of my job. Some other strengths I believe set me aside from other developers is definetely time management, logical thinking, and my strive. I am always looking to learn new things. My logical thinking has been developed and improved with my experience in Java. It allows me to not only problem solve more efficiently, but it allows me to approach problems from multiple perspectives and angles.</p>

        <h1>My Weaknesses</h1>
        <p>One of my biggest weaknesses would definetly be my confidence. I notice not only in my day job is that I don't really speak out too much. This weakness definetely gives me confidence issues, but it's something I try to improve on whenever I get the chance.</p>
